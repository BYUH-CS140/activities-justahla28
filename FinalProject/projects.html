            <p contenteditable="true">
              As an FSY (For the Strength of Youth) Coordinator for the LDS Church in New Zealand, I led the planning and execution of a nationwide youth conference hosting over 850 participants and managing a team of 40+ counselors. I was responsible for coordinating all logistics, including flight arrangements, accommodations, and on-site scheduling to ensure timely and safe arrivals. I oversaw daily programming, meals, entertainment, and spiritual activities, while managing both a health and logistics team to support operations. This role demanded exceptional leadership, organization, and problem-solving skills to deliver a seamless and impactful experience for youth from across the country.

            <h2>Web Page Designing Resume</h2>
            <p contenteditable="true">
              For my computer science class, we were tasked with creating a functional and visually appealing webpage. I chose to design a personal resume website that highlights my background, skills, and accomplishments. The site includes multiple sections such as a homepage, resume, projects, and contact page, all built using HTML and styled with custom CSS. I implemented responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices and used a grid layout to organize content clearly and professionally. This project allowed me to apply front-end development skills in a real-world context and showcase my ability to design and build user-friendly web experiences.
